## React Game of Life
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using React.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

### Usage
Once you have the development server up and running, you can access the app at http://localhost:3000. The app consists of a game board and a set of controls.

To use the app, follow these steps:

Click on the game board to toggle cells between dead and alive.
Use the controls to start, stop, generate a random board or clean all the cells.
You can set the generation speed using the speed slider.
Every generation number is printed on the screen, the game ends when there are no cells alive.
